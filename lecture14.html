        <p>In this workshop, we learned about negotiation skills and how important they are in day to day life. We were divided into groups and tasked with doing an act where negotiation was needed. after the first attempt, the lecturer provided the appropriate methods, strategies, and principles of negotiation. after that We had to redo the same act to see the difference after learning the approaches. This made the lecture both practical and entertaining, while showing us how negotiation works in real life situations.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <p>I understood that negotiation is not arguing but discovering a fair and win win solution. I was taught lots of  terms , which help in making solid and realistic agreements. The workshop also highlighted active listening, staying calm, creating rapport, and understanding the other person's needs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now I know negotiation isn't just helpful in business but also in everyday life, and it helps in building relationships, resolving conflicts, and achieving improved outcomes.</p>
