        <p>This session taught us how to prepare and perform well during job interviews by practicing good verbal and non verbal communication. We learned that interviews are a two way conversation in which the interviewer is probing for fit and the candidate is probing the job. The lecture covered step by step practicals   research firm and role, prepare answers (use STAR), practice body language, manage nerves, and prepare a professional certificate file. so we can show confidence and give clear, detailed answers.</p>
        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Interviews are about giving evidence of your skills and also learning about the job.</li>
          <li>Best interview strategy is to prepare what you'd like the interviewer to know, weaknesses to downplay, and what you need to ask.</li>
          <li>Non verbal communication is very important: 7% words, 38% tone, 55% body language (posture, eye contact, smiling matter a lot)</li>
          <li>Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure answers to behaviour questions.</li>
          <li>Prepare by doing background reading on the company, job specification, and practicing standard questions (tell me about yourself; strengths/weaknesses; conflict examples; where do you see yourself in 5 years).</li>
          <li>Dress professionally, appear professional, arrive on time, and bring a neat certificate folder with supporting documentation.</li>
          <li>use present tense for listing strengths, past tense for experience, and using precise examples with numbers wherever possible.</li>
          <li>ask thoughtful questions, say company name, speak with examples, show enthusiasm.</li>
          <li>don't be late, speak ill of past companies, interrupt, disclose too much about yourself, or use your phone.</li>
          <li>Send a thank you email within 24 hours to show appreciation and reaffirm interest.</li>
          <li></li>
