        <!-- <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In this session we were instructed to attend the research conference (ARCSCU) online and prepare a short report for Moodle.he conference included keynote talks on Artificial Intelligence, Capitalism & Sustainability, and Unconventional Computing.Each talk gave clear, real-world examples: AI helping farming and remote health, the need for responsible capitalism that balances profit and social good, and innovative computing ideas using biological and chemical processes.The lecture helped me understand current research trends and gave useful points to include in the assignment report.</p>
        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Artificial Intelligence - Prof. Mahesha Kapurubandara
            <ul>
              <li>AI is trained on data and improves with practice. It already has everyday applications (Siri, Netflix, online banking).</li>
              <li>AI does not have feelings or values, so humans must direct it in a responsible way.</li>
              <li>AI can help solve real problems (farming, remote health).</li>
              <li>Risks include bias, energy use, and inequality if mismanaged.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <br>
          <li>Capitalism & Sustainability - Mr. Kalana Muthumuni
            <ul>
              <li>Profit driven business hoices occasionally overlook human needs also sustainable business models are more durable and longer lasting.</li>
              <li>Credit and finance need to be properly managed in order to fund small businesses without causing their collapse.</li>
              <li>Individuals prefer to conduct business with firms that do social well being. "profit at any cost" is harmful.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Unconventional Computing - Dr. Ed Braund
            <ul>
              <li>New methods of computing utilize biological, chemical, or physical systems.</li>
              <li>These systems can be self-healing, grow, and be more eco-friendly than traditional hardware.</li>
              <li>Multimodal sensing and emerging devices create new research directions beyond traditional computers.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <p>I joined the conference through online and found the talks both interesting and practical for my assignment. Prof. Kapurubandara’s farming AI example helped me see how AI works in real life, and Mr. Muthumuni’s talk made me think about ethics and long term business value. Dr. Braund’s unconventional computing talk was new and exciting. It showed ideas I had never considered.</p>
