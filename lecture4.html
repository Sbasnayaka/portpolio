        <p>Through this lecture, we learned about what a portfolio is and how it is beneficial to students and professionals. Our lecturer explained different types of portfolios (personal, career, employment, assessment) and provided real-world steps to build an assessment portfolio. We also learned how to present proof of competence, revise the portfolio, protect privacy, and use web platforms like LinkedIn, Google Sites and GitHub Pages to share work. In general, the lecture gave a straightforward step by step approach to building a portfolio that supports learning, job hunting, and professional growth.</p>
        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A portfolio shows real work and shows competence more than a CV alone.</li>
          <li>Main uses: job applications, career advancement, academic assessment, personal branding, freelancing, and networking.</li>
          <li>Types: personal/creative, career, employment, and assessment portfolios.</li>
          <li>Start by defining the purpose and the audience.this decides what to include and how to present it.</li>
          <li>Choose a format: digital (website, PDF) is more flexible and shareable than printed.</li>
          <li>Collect evidence: projects, reports, certificates, transcripts, reflections, and references.</li>
          <li>For each project add context: what you did, what you learned, and measurable outcomes where they exist.</li>
          <li>Organize with clean sections (intro, CV, projects, skills, certificates, reflections).</li>
          <li>Keep the design clean and professional.</li>
          <li>Regularly update the portfolio and keep backups.</li>
          <li>Protect privacy by not sharing sensitive information.</li>
          <li>Use web platforms like LinkedIn, Google Sites, and GitHub Pages to share work.</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <p>This lecture helped me realize that a portfolio is more than just uploading files it tells my learning story.Then i began organizing my work by saving project documents, certificates, and short reflections for every entry. I chose to create a digital portfolio since it’s easier to update and share, and I plan to include reflective notes for each project to explain my role and learning. </p>
